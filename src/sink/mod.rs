/// A `Sink` is a value into which other values can be sent, asynchronously.
///
/// Basic examples of sinks include the sending side of:
///
/// - Channels
/// - Sockets
/// - Pipes
///
/// In addition to such "primitive" sinks, it's typical to layer additional
/// functionality, such as buffering, on top of an existing sink.
///
/// Sending to a sink is "asynchronous" in the sense that the value may not be
/// sent in its entirety immediately. Instead, values are sent in a two-phase
/// way: first by initiating a send, and then by polling for completion. This
/// two-phase setup is analogous to buffered writing in synchronous code, where
/// writes often succeed immediately, but internally are buffered and are
/// *actually* written only upon flushing.
///
/// In addition, the `Sink` may be *full*, in which case it is not even possible
/// to start the sending process.
///
/// As with `Future` and `Stream`, the `Sink` trait is built from a few core
/// required methods, and a host of default methods for working in a
/// higher-level way. The `Sink::send_all` combinator is of particular
/// importance: you can use it to send an entire stream to a sink, which is
/// the simplest way to ultimately consume a sink.
///
/// You can find more information/tutorials about streams [online at
/// https://tokio.rs][online]

    /// Begin the process of sending a value to the sink.
    ///
    /// As the name suggests, this method only *begins* the process of sending
    /// the item. If the sink employs buffering, the item isn't fully processed
    /// until the buffer is fully flushed. Since sinks are designed to work with
    /// asynchronous I/O, the process of actually writing out the data to an
    /// underlying object takes place asynchronously. **You *must* use
    /// `poll_complete` in order to drive completion of a send**. In particular,
    /// `start_send` does not begin the flushing process
    ///
    /// # Return value
    ///
    /// This method returns `AsyncSink::Ready` if the sink was able to start
    /// sending `item`. In that case, you *must* ensure that you call
    /// `poll_complete` to process the sent item to completion. Note, however,
    /// that several calls to `start_send` can be made prior to calling
    /// `poll_complete`, which will work on completing all pending items.
    ///
    /// The method returns `AsyncSink::NotReady` if the sink was unable to begin
    /// sending, usually due to being full. The sink must have attempted to
    /// complete processing any outstanding requests (equivalent to
    /// `poll_complete`) before yielding this result. The current task will be
    /// automatically scheduled for notification when the sink may be ready to
    /// receive new values.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// If the sink encounters an error other than being temporarily full, it
    /// uses the `Err` variant to signal that error. In most cases, such errors
    /// mean that the sink will permanently be unable to receive items.

    /// This method may panic in a few situations, depending on the specific
    /// sink:
    ///
    /// - It is called outside of the context of a task.
    /// - A previous call to `start_send` or `poll_complete` yielded a permanent
    /// error.
    ///

    ///

    /// able to return `AsyncSink::Ready`.

    /// completed.
    ///
    /// Since sinks are asynchronous, no single method completes all of their
    /// work in one shot. Instead, you use `poll_complete` to repeatedly drive
    /// the sink to make progress on requests (such as `start_send`). As with
    /// `Future::poll`, if the pending requests are not able to complete during
    /// this call, the current task is automatically scheduled to be woken up
    /// again once more progress is possible.

    ///
    /// Returns `Ok(Async::Ready(()))` when no unprocessed requests remain.

    /// case the current task is scheduled to wake up when more progress may be
    /// possible.

    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// Returns `Err` if the sink encounters an error while processing one of
    /// its pending requests. Due to the buffered nature of requests, it is not
    /// generally possible to correlate the error with a particular request. As
